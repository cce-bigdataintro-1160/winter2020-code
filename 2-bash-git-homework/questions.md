#1. formulate a research question for your dataset

#2. write the steps detailing your preliminary idea of how to answer it (can be very brief).

Step 1: Get the data in a format I can work with

Step 2: Decide which are the best tools to answer my question
 and prepare them
 
Step 3: Prepare data for analysis, perform exploratory data
 analysis and find outliers, obvious discrepancies, averages,
  standard deviations, etc
  
Step 4: Visualize my data and its correlations to further expand
 my knowledge of my data
 
Step 5: Based on previous findings, choose the algorithms to 
extract a model from my data. Prepare Training & Test dataset

Step 6: Create Models for predicting my final values and perform
 testing
 
Step 7: Validate and measure performance of the Models and choose
 best Model
 
Step 8: Present my conclusions. If the result was a failure, 
explain whether it’s impossible to predict it or what do we miss in order to improve our results.

Step 9: If we have a conclusive and successfull model, 
industrialize and offer it as a service
